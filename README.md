Making Games with Lua and Love
==============================

This is the complete source code and slides for a talk I gave
for the [Cal Poly Game Development Club](http://www.cpgd.org
"CPGD Website") in January of 2011 in preparation for the
Global Game Jam.

The slides explain the basic syntax of the Lua Language, some
standard game programming paradigms, and how the LOVE framework
is structured.

In the workshop portion of the talk (after the slides), we built
the simple game contained in the source. To run this game, clone
the GitHub repository (or download the files), then drag the
directory onto your LOVE executable and away you go!
